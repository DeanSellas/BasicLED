# BasicLED
This is a very basic LED library for Arduino Boards.

Originally was part of the [FAR :rocket:](https://github.com/DeanSellas/FAR) Project I am working on but I split it off to its own library since it has more uses outside of just Avionics recorders.

Documentation and features list to come...
